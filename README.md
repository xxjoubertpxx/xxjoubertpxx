- 👋 Hi, I’m Joubert Polson
- 👀 I’m interested in python as a fundamental base for my futute endevors and c++ on the side for game and app development
- 🌱 I’m currently investing all my time into python, but I dabble in Matlab and c++ from time to time
- 💞️ I love trying to make my ideas come to life and learning from solving errors for hours (even if it is frustrating sometimes)
- 📫 How to reach me joubert@polsons.info
